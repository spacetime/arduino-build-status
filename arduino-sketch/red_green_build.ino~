/*
  Physical Pixel
 
 An example of using the Arduino board to receive data from the 
 computer.  In this case, the Arduino boards turns on an LED when
 it receives the character 'H', and turns off the LED when it
 receives the character 'L'.
 
 The data can be sent from the Arduino serial monitor, or another
 program like Processing (see code below), Flash (via a serial-net
 proxy), PD, or Max/MSP.
 
 The circuit:
 * LED connected from digital pin 13 to ground
